    "title": "European and global stocks slide as Trump tariff threats linked to Greenland rattle investors",
    "summary": "Equities weakened as markets priced in renewed trade and geopolitical risk after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened additional tariffs on multiple European countries tied to a dispute over U.S. access to (or purchase of) Greenland. In Europe, the STOXX 600 logged its biggest drop in about two months, while safe-haven assets (yen/Swiss franc) and gold drew support.",
    "context": "- Why markets cared: Tariff threats quickly raise uncertainty around earnings, supply chains, and pricing power—especially for export-heavy European sectors.\\n\\n- Cross-asset reaction: Risk-off flows typically strengthen safe havens (JPY/CHF) and support gold while pressuring cyclical equities.\\n\\n- Why it mattered for conditions: Policy shocks can tighten financial conditions without a central-bank move by increasing risk premia and volatility.",

    "title": "Japan bond selloff pushes long-dated yields to record highs, rippling through global bond markets",
    "summary": "A sharp move higher in long-dated Japanese government bond yields—driven by election-linked fiscal concerns—spilled into other major bond markets, highlighting investor sensitivity to debt supply and fiscal sustainability.",
    "context": "- Global rates linkage: Japan’s huge bond market influences global term premia; a rapid JGB repricing can transmit to U.S./EU curves via relative-value and hedging channels.\\n\\n- Flow effects: Higher JGB yields can change incentives for Japanese investors to hold foreign bonds, impacting global demand for Treasuries and other sovereign debt.\\n\\n- Risk-asset implications: Rising long-end yields can pressure equity valuations and credit by increasing discount rates and tightening financing conditions.",

    "title": "US investment-grade credit spreads hit fresh multi-decade lows as bond demand stays strong despite volatility",
    "summary": "US investment-grade credit spreads tightened to very low levels, signalling strong investor appetite for high-quality corporate debt even as other markets were volatile. Issuance remained active, supported by steady demand from long-term buyers.",
    "context": "- What tight spreads signal: Credit investors are demanding little extra yield over Treasuries, implying strong risk appetite and easy corporate funding conditions.\\n\\n- Market impact: Lower borrowing costs can support refinancing, buybacks, and capex, helping equities and corporate balance sheets in the short run.\\n\\n- Hidden fragility: When spreads are extremely tight, credit can be more vulnerable to shocks (growth scares, rate volatility, downgrades) because there’s less cushion for repricing.",
