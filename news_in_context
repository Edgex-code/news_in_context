    "title": "U.S. Inflation Resists Fed Targets as CPI Data Normalizes Post-Shutdown",
    "summary": "Key inflation data released this week showed the Consumer Price Index (CPI) remaining stubbornly above the Federal Reserve's target, with headline inflation reaching 2.7% year-on-year. This was the first clear look at the U.S. economy following recent government data disruptions, signaling that price pressures in food and utilities are offsetting declines in energy and used vehicles.",
    "context": "- Food prices rose at their fastest monthly pace since 2022, primarily driven by supply chain shifts and seasonal demand.\n\n- Markets had hoped for a sharper cooling of core services, but rent and owners' equivalent rent categories remained elevated.\n\n- The data reinforced the Federal Reserve's recent decision to hold rates steady, as officials await evidence that inflationary effects from new tariffs will be temporary.\n\n- Treasury yields fluctuated as traders adjusted bets, now pricing in a 'higher-for-longer' scenario through at least the first half of 2026.",

    "summary": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded its Article IV consultation with Australia, commending the nation's resilient economy and its transition toward a soft landing.
